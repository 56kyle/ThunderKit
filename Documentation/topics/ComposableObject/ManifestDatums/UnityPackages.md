The UnityPackages ManifestDatum allows ThunderKit to define assets and settings for building a Unity Asset Package.

Asset Packages are aimed at building re-useable and redistributable collections of Unity Assets for sharing assets between Unity Projects.

ThunderKit provides an asset based method of building Asset Packages via the UnityPackages ManifestDatum and the UnityPackage ScriptableObject

To create a UnityPackage, use the project context menu and navigate to ThunderKit/UnityPackage
