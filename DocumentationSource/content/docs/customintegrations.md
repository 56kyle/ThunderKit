One of ThunderKit core features is extensibility, and easy integration with mod storage platforms and modding frameworks is the primary aim of that.

Many integrations for ThunderKit may not need any new code, and others may want to add a lot to add common functionality.

To do these copies you can use Copy File, Copy Recursive and Copy Recursive Per Manifest.
